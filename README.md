ZappKit -- a kit for building Zapps
===================================

Zapps (see [zapps.app](https://zapps.app/) !) are a convention for packaging linux executables
in a highly portable and distro-agnostic way.

More information about Zapps can be found in the website,
but in brief: Zapps offer simplicity of distribution on par with static linking, while still using dynamic libraries.
This means any application can be packaged as a Zapp (often, without even rebuilding!).

This repo is to collect tools which help produce Zapps.
